1. 简单句 → 基础的重中之重
2. 并列句 : 多件事一样重要
3. 复合句 : 多件事不一样重要

[n.+v.]+conj.+[n.+v.]+conj.+[n.+v.] = 主句 + 从句 = 连接词+ 陈述句

conj. 是连词

**### 状语从句的省略**

状语对 原句进行补充 e.g. 时间/ 原因…

→ Because she was punished, she burst into tears (因为受到惩罚，她泪流满面)

↘︎ Because punished, she burst into tears. (相同的内容省略, 此处 Punished 变成非谓语动词, 不作谓语, 表被动, 做状语)

↘︎ Punished, she burst into tears. (省略连接词)
