如何复习新概念

* 单词复习时, 有三个要点

  * 声音

  * 单词拼写

  * 单词用法(可数不可数, 及物不及物, 与什么介词搭配, 单词精确的含义是什么, 有什么样的感情色彩和语体色彩, 一般用在什么场合, 跟它类似的有什么近义词, 哪些场景下可以替换, 哪些场景下不能替换)

* 课文复习
  * 语法, 课文中的语法成分
  * 习语搭配与句式, 黄金句型, 句型的确切含义, 使用的场合.
  * 句子句法, 决定句子是否精彩/漂亮/地道/简洁.
  * 篇章段落结构
  * 看着中文译文. **默写课文**.  用来检验前面的复习是否到位, 单词写错, 语法错了, 句型错了, 习语搭配错了, 句法思维错了, 还是中式思维 等....

       * 定语从句的关系代词做主语, 如果后面紧跟的 be 动词, 一般来说, 我们可以把做主语的关系代词 和 be 动词同时省略. 非谓语动词 做后置定语

4. * be found in... 动植物 生存于某地, 某个物质存在于某地, 产于某地
     * → Many plant and animal species **are found** only **in** the rainforests.

   * 定语从句 和 同位语从句 的区别
     * 同位语从句 是定语从句的一个外甥,  
     * 从句分为 三类, 定语从句(形容词性从句, 修饰名词), 状语从句(副词性从句), 名词性从句
       * 名词性从句
         * 主语从句
         * 宾语从句
         * 表语从句
         * 同位语从句
     * 从定义上看, 
       * 同位语从句解释前面名词的具体作用; 
       * 定语从句 仅起到后置定语的作用, 常译为 ".....的"
     * 从形式上看
       * 同位语从句中的 "that" 仅 起到 **连接符号** 的作用, 不充当 语法成分;
       * 定语从句中的 "that" 时关系代词, 在从句中充当主语/宾语/表语
     * → The proposal that **John should be dismissed** is unacceptable. (同位语, 这里 that 可以随便去掉, `John should be dismissed` 就是 proposal 的内容)
     * → The proposal that **John put forward** is unacceptable. (定语从句, 这里 John put forward 意思不完整, 需要带上前面的 The proposal , that 不能随便去掉, 所以是定语从句)
     * → When reports came into London Zoo **that** a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London. (同位语从句)
       * 这里的的 后面的同位语从句离开 前面的名词 reports 比较远, 原因是 这个 从句比较长, 而 主句的 came into London Zoo 又比较短, 所以这里没有像例句那样直接把从句跟在同位语的名词后面, 而是把 从句移到了最后
       * 英语在写作时, 句子中比较累赘的东西会比较习惯往后放, 比较间断的东西会往前放.

* had been spotted / seen /found /observed 都表示看到, 可以相互替换

  * → a wild puma <u>had been spotted</u> forty-five miles south of London.
  * → people who claimed to <u>have seen</u> the puma were extraodinarily similar.
  * → ....for the puma <u>was often observed</u> at one place in the morning and at ....

    * →  a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles <u>south of London</u> 
    * 西安南部一百公里处
      * →  100 kilometers south of Xi'an.

* → They were not taken seriously.

  * take sth. seriously  严肃对待, 重视
  * seriously adv. 严肃的, 认真的, 非常

    * → They were taken lightly.
  * take 在这里是看待, 对待的意思.

* →  When reports came into  Landon Zoo that a wild puma have been spotted firty-five miles south of Landon, They were not taken seriously.

  * 造句: 当消息(news) 传到了国家博物馆 (the national museum), 说是在西安以南 100 公里处发现了一座古墓(an ancient tomb), 这则消息受到了重视.
    * → When news came into the national museum that a ancient tomb have been spotted/seen/found/observed one handrad kilometers south of Xi'an, It were taken seriously.

* investigate v. 调查

* as 引导时间状语从句

* expert 专家

* for 引导原因状语从句, 起到补充说明, 因果关系不强烈, 所以 for 引导的从句一般不放在句首, 放在主句后面或者中间, 一般会在前面加个逗号, 补充说明

  * → experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, **<u>for</u>** the descriptions <u>given by people.</u>

* give descriptions. 作描述

  * descriptions given by people <= descriptions <u>which were</u> given by people
    * 定语从句 的关系词如果做主语 , 那么 关系词 和 后面的 be 动词可以同时省略
  * make description
    * descriptions make description <= ... descriptions made by people....
  * 这叫做 非谓语动词 做了 后置定语 修饰名词, 非谓语动词 有三种形式
    * 现在分词形式 - 主动
    * 过去分词形式 - 被动
    * 不定式形式 - 目的, 要做
    * → (NCE3-1 P14-L7) The hunt for the puma began in a small village where <u>a woman **picking** blackberries</u> saw a large cat only five yards away from her.
      * 这里 picking 作为后置的定语, 修饰前面的 woman, 进一步增加描述
    * → (NCE3-7 P38-L10) John had a very good day and put <u>his wallet **containing** $3000</u> into the microwave oven for safekeeping
      * 这里 containing 也是一样, 修饰前面的钱包, 进一步加强说明
    * →  (NCE3-8 P42-L4) For hundreds of years, St. Bernard dogs have saved the lives of <u>travellers **crossing** the dangerous Pass.</u>
      * 补充说明是什么游客, 穿越危险山口的游客. 如果更细的说明的话, 应该就需要从句了. 这里简单说明可以用 后置定语, 修饰名词
    * 仿写: 
      * 鲁迅写的小说 - novels written by Xun Lu.
      * 张艺谋的电影 - movies directed by YiMou Zhang.
      * 那个靠在墙上, 名字叫乔治的男人是我哥哥- The man  leaning against the wall named George is my brother.

* claim 声称

  * claim to have done. 声称曾经做过某事, (表示之前做过)
    * → people who <u>claimed to have seen</u> the puma were extraordinarily similar.
    * 为什么这里要 to 和 完成时态连用, 只用 claim 加 have done 不行么?
      1. 固定搭配, claim 只能和 to 连用
      2. 但 to 只能表示 目的要做, 但这里又要表示之前已经做过, 所以只能 在后面接上完成时态, 最后造成了这个比较奇怪的样子.
         * 再举一个例子
           * → Everyone went to the funeral, for the 'ghost' was none other than Eric Cox, a third brother who was supposed <u>to have died</u> as a young man.
             * be supposed to do 是固定结构
             * 但又要表达完成时态.
  * claim to do ... 声称做某事. (表示之后要做)
    * → So far, no organization has <u>claimed to be responsible</u> for the accident.

* were extraordinarily similar(类似的)

  * extraordinarily 特别的, 与众不同的
    * 美语中 通常会有 重音后移的现象
  * 更多的 "特别的相似" 的表达

    * had a lot in common
      * have some sth in common  有共同的 ..... 东西
    * had considerable(相当多的, 客观的, 书面形容词) commonalities(共同之处) 有相当多的共同之处

    * → I guess <u>we do look a little bit alike</u> 

  * 造句: 随着 病例 (case) 开始慢慢增多, 医学专家们 (specialist) 觉得必须要调查了, 因为得了这种病的人的症状 (symptom) 特别地相似.
    * → As the cases began to accumulate, specialists felt obliged to investigate, for the symptoms of people who had caught the disease were extraordinarily similar.

* hunt for ... 出去打猎的意思

* wherever 

  * 疑问词 + ever (whenever, wherever, whoever, whichever, whatever) 有两个含义: 
    1. 表示 "无论....", 引导让步状语从句. 
       * = no matter + 疑问词
         * whenever = no matter when
         * whoever = no matter who
         * Wherever it went  => No matter where it went, ...
         * → (NCE3-29 P138-L8) <u>No matter where</u> you live, you would find it difficult not to laugh at, say, Charlie Chaplin's early films.
    2. 表示 "到底....", 用于 疑问句中, 加强疑问句的语气

           * → Answer: (C) Why do you keep on making the same mistakes.

* → Wherever it went, it left <u>behind it</u> a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits.

  * 这里为了句式平衡, 牺牲了正常的语序, 这里的 谓语是 "a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits.", 状语是 behind it.
  * 如果一个句子里的及物动词后的宾语太长, 状语比较短,可以先写 状语, 把宾语放到最后去.
  * a trail of 一条小路/ 小径, 一连串的
    * Wherever he went, he left a trail of ..... behind him. 不管他在哪, 总会留下一连串的 ... 
      * → Wherever he went, he left a trail of <u>unpaid bils</u> behind him.
      * → Wherever he went, he left a trail of <u>broken hearts</u> behind him. (playboy)

* one deer, two deer / one sheep , two sheep / one fish , two fish 单复数同形

* 句尾的 like 做介词构成介词短语, 动词是喜欢, 介词是像

* print n. 印痕

  * → <u>Paw prints</u>(掌印, 无灵主语) were seen in a number of places and puma <u>fur</u> was found clinging to bushes.
    * 本文 使用 paw prints 无灵主语 做主语的好处
      * 没有必要用 people 做主句, 比较简洁, 因为不可能是 苍蝇发现的
      * 突出了句子的核心内容, 一个句子里, 句首和句尾 会比较重要, 把 掌痕放在句首, 突出重点
      * 例句: 人们对下岗工人的生活状况越来越关注了
        * → People have paid more and more attention to the condition of the laid-off(短期解聘的) workers.  (不佳, people 是废话, 不可能是 狗关注下岗工人的生活, 这个新闻的关键点在 "越来越关注了" 的这个变化)
        * →  Increasing attention has been paid to the codition of the laid-off workers. (佳, 语法正确是相对容易的, 但要注意写的地道,  )
        *  fur 皮毛, 皮和毛放到一块
        * a fur coat 裘皮大衣
        * feather 羽毛
          * fur and feather 飞禽走兽 (借代修辞, fur 是走兽的特征, feature 是 飞禽的特征, 英语中 短的一般放前面, 长的一般放后面)
          * fin, fur and feature 各种各样的动物 (fin 是鱼鳍, 鱼翅, 天上飞的, 地上跑的, 水里游的. 这里除了用到借代修辞, 还用到了压首韵的手法)
      * The crown(王权) should not yield(屈服) to the cross(十字架). (这里也是借代的手法, 同时 crown 和 cross 压了首韵, ) 
      * 借代手法在中文里

        * 巾帼不让须眉
        * 过尽千帆皆不是, 斜晖脉脉水悠悠
    * cling v. 粘

        * →  (L14) As no pumas had been reported <u>missing</u> from any zoo in the country, ...
        * → The fire was reported <u>controlled</u>. (佳)
          * →  It is reported that the fire was controlled. (不佳)
          * 巧妙的使用 主语补足语, 可以让句子更加简洁和精练.

* Complain of / about sth. 

  * complain 是不及物动词, 不能直接接名词, 通常后面加 of / about
  * complain (that) 某人抱怨说 的时候, 后面可以跟 that 引导的定语从句, 这时可以省略 complain 后的介词
    * → She <u>complained that</u> no one had been at the airport to meet her.
    * 为什么这个句子使用 "She complained of that .... ", 因为 that 引导的句子一般来说不需要跟在介词后面. 不需要在介词之后, 是 that 这个词引导的句子 最明显的 特征之一. 宾语从句前是不能加介词的, 所以这里为了接 宾语从句 牺牲了 介词.
      * 例外情况: 
        * in that ... (复合连词, 表因为, 放在句子中部)
        * except / but that ... (除了... 情况之外.. , 复合连词)  

* 介词 on 经常表示 在 ... 的路上, 不要用中文理解, 中文里面 "中" 和 "上" 都行

    * → The experts <u>were</u> now fully <u>convinced that</u> the animal was a puma.
  * convince sb. of sth. (convince sb. 连读, ce 不发音, 直接发后面的 sb. 的 s)

* 英文文章中 如果遇到斜体印刷, 需要重读 , 例如下面的 

  * →  the animal *was* a puma

* as 做连词也可以表示 原因状语从句

  * → <u>As</u> no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo inthe country, this one must have been in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape.
    * must have done  表示语气, 表示强烈的<u>推测</u>语气, must 表示推测说明 非常有把握, 情态动词的完成时.
