  1. 不作谓语的动词
  2. 什么时候用非谓语动词
     * 在已经有谓语动词的情况下, 用非谓语动词, 一个主语只能有一个谓语, 其余的 动词需要变成非谓语动词
  3. 非谓语动词分几种
     * doing/done/to do (不一定是非谓语, 必须单独出现才是非谓语)
     * be doing 不是 非谓语是进行时态
     * be done 不是非谓语是被动语态
     * 情态, 时态, 语态, 都是谓语的特征
     * 非谓语独立出现, 旁边没有别的动词

* 非谓语动词的作用

  1. 相当于名词来用, 可作主语/宾语/表语, 仅(doing/to do), 另外, doing 可变成词组
     * 作主语

         * → = To Fish is my favorite sport.
       * → Playing basketball is my favorite sport

     * 作宾语, 介宾用  doing , 动宾用 doing/to do 
       * → I often fish for hours without(介) catching anything.
         * 介词后面只能接代词/名词/动名词 , 所以此处只能用 doing
       * → Both men started <u>running through the trees (关于 doing 的词组)</u>. L44

         * =→ My dream is to traveling around the world.

     * 修饰名词作定语
       * → <u>Passing planes(经过的飞机)</u> can be heard night and day
       * → I was the only passenger <u>left on the bus</u> 修饰前面的 passenger

     2. 修饰 名词 / 句子, 作 定语 / 状语 (doing / done / to do)

  * finding 是非谓语, 介后动名词, 
  * lost 是非谓语, 修饰后面的 名词 treasure, 

* → A new machine <u>called 'The Revealer'</u> has been invented. 

  * call 非谓语, called 'The Revealer' 整个是个 定语, 修饰前面的名词
  * 如何判断哪个是谓语动词? 观察 3态1否

    1. 表示过去将来时
    2. 表示过去常常做某时
